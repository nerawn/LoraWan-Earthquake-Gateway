# LoRaWAN Seismic Monitoring Station

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the implementation of a seismic monitoring station using ESP8266 NodeMCU. It's designed to capture and display real-time seismic data via a web interface that is accessible over a local network.

## Features
- Real-time seismic data monitoring.
- Web interface for easy access to data.
- MPU6050 sensor integration for accurate motion detection.
- LoRa communication for master and slave functionality within the network.

## Technologies
- **ESP8266 NodeMCU:** For the core microcontroller and Wi-Fi capabilities.
- **LittleFS:** For the efficient file system management in ESP8266.
- **HTML/CSS/JS:** For creating the user-friendly web interface.
- **LoRa:** Utilized for long-range, low-power communication between devices.

## Usage
The project can be utilized in earthquake monitoring systems and early warning mechanisms to facilitate quick response and potentially save lives.

## Installation
Clone the repository and upload the files to your ESP8266 NodeMCU using PlatformIO or your preferred IDE that supports ESP8266.
